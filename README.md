> NOTE: Cinder Standalone Provisioner, Manila Provisioner and Cinder FlexVolume Driver were removed since release v1.18.0.

> Version 1.17 was the last release of Manila Provisioner, which is unmaintained from now on. Due to dependency issues, we removed the code from master but it is still accessible in the [release-1.17](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/tree/release-1.17) branch. Please consider migrating to Manila CSI Plugin.
