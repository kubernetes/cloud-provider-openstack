# Release Procedure

The Cloud Provider OpenStack Release is done in sync with
kubernetes/kubernetes. Minor versions can be released intermittently for
critical bug fixes.

## Making a Release

1. Checkout the release branch.

```bash
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout -b my-release upstream/release-X.Y
```

2. Update the minor version with the expected version.

Make changes in the `docs/manifests/tests/examples` directories using the
`hack/bump_release.sh` script by running the following command:

```bash
$ hack/bump-release.sh 28 29 0
```

This will replace `1.28.x`/`2.28.x` with `1.29.0`/`2.29.0` strings in the
`docs/manifests/tests/examples` directories. Ensure that you double-check the
diff before committing the changes. Non-related changes must not be shipped.

3. Create a new pull request (PR) and make sure all CI checks have passed.

4. Once the PR is merged, make a tag and push it to the upstream repository.

```bash
$ git checkout -b release-X.Y upstream/release-X.Y
$ git pull upstream release-X.Y --tags
$ git tag -m "Release for cloud-provider-openstack to support Kubernetes release x" vX.Y.Z
$ git push upstream vX.Y.Z
```

5. [Github Actions](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/actions/workflows/release-cpo.yaml) will create new [Docker images](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/k8s-staging-provider-os) and generate a [new draft release](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/releases) in the repository.

6. Create release notes using the "Generate release notes" button in the GitHub "New release" UI and publish the release.
